With a heavy heart, I announce that this account will be inactive for the foreseeable future. Thank you all for ***3*** **incredible** years on this journey. Each of you has left an indelible mark on my life, and I am profoundly grateful. 

To the amazing souls who have shaped me for the better:

- [Furdox](https://github.com/Furdox)
- [Lmay](https://github.com/win10Device)
- [Kami](https://github.com/kamilatte)

Your support and friendship have meant the world to me.

I will be moving over to @[stellaOnEstrogen](https://github.com/stellaOnEstrogen) for a fresh start and new adventures. 

Once more, thank you all for these amazing years and for helping me grow in ways I never imagined. 

Special thanks to everyone who has been a part of Goddess Anime, VtuberWiki, Procs, and Red Cafe... You have my deepest gratitude.
